An old man was teaching his grandson about life.
“A fierce fight is going on inside me,” the man said to the boy. “It is between two wolves. 
One wolf is evil. He is guilt, anger, envy, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, resentment, lies, inferiority, false pride, superiority, self-doubt, and ego. 
 The second wolf is good. He is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.  It is a terrible fight, and the same fight is going on inside you, and every other person, too.”
The boy thought for a minute about what his grandfather had said.
“Which wolf will win the fight?” the boy asked.
The old man replied simply, “The one that I feed.”

ProRes RAW. Is it ProRes? Is it raw? What is ProRes even? How do I get it? Why do I want it? What do I do with it once I have it? 

Okay, okay! We heard you. ProRes RAW is an exciting and relatively new video format, but it brings with it an almost endless number of questions. 

I will start off by saying that it is well worth the effort since raw video can offer increased dynamic range and detail than standard formats. 

Also, you do have to be sure that every stage in your process supports ProRes RAW. If you follow along here, we will help get you from capture, through the edit, and, hopefully, to a finished video project.
