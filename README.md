An old man was teaching his grandson about life.
“A fierce fight is going on inside me,” the man said to the boy. “It is between two wolves. 
One wolf is evil. He is guilt, anger, envy, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, resentment, lies, inferiority, false pride, superiority, self-doubt, and ego. 
 The second wolf is good. He is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.  It is a terrible fight, and the same fight is going on inside you, and every other person, too.”
The boy thought for a minute about what his grandfather had said.
“Which wolf will win the fight?” the boy asked.
The old man replied simply, “The one that I feed.”
